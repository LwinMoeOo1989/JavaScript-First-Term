 Assignment 4 Part 1: Create a FAQs Rollover application

 In this assignment, youâ€™ll write the jQuery code for an application that displays 
 the answer to a question in a list of questions when the user hovers the mouse over 
 that question.

 1. Review the content of the starter folder, faqs_rollover.
 2. Review the HTML to see that it includes an unordered list with list items that consist 
 of an h2 element and a <p> element. The h2 element contains a question, and the <p> element, 
 which is hidden, contains the answer to the question.

 *3. Add jQuery code that runs when the user moves the mouse pointer into or out of a 
 question in the list. When the mouse pointer moves into the question, the answer should 
 be displayed. When the mouse pointer moves out of the question, the answer should be hidden.
 *4. In index.html, change the text in the <small> tag to your name and student number.
