 Assignment 4 Part 2: Develop an Image Gallery application with animation

 In this assignment, you’ll develop an Image Gallery application that displays different 
 images when the user clicks on the links at the top of the page. This works like the 
 Image Swap application. You’ll then use effects to change the way the images are 
 displayed and hidden.

 1. Review the content of the starter folder, image_gallery.

 *2. In the JavaScript file, add an event handler for the ready() event method.
 *3. Use the each() method to run a function for each <a> element in the unordered list 
 of items. Then, add jQuery code that gets the URL and caption for each image and preloads 
 the image. You can get the URL from the href attribute of the <a> element, and you can 
 get the caption from the title attribute.
 *4. Add an event handler for the click() event method of each link. The function for 
 this event handler should accept a parameter named event. The jQuery code for this event 
 handler should display the image and caption for the link that was clicked. In addition, 
 it should use the event parameter to cancel the default action of the link.
 *5. Add a jQuery statement that moves the focus to the first link on the page when 
 the page is loaded.
 *6. Modify the jQuery so that when a link is clicked, the current caption and image 
 are hidden using a sliding motion that takes three seconds.
 *7. Modify the jQuery so that after the caption and URL are set for the new image, 
 that caption and image are displayed using a sliding motion that takes three seconds.
 *8. In index.html, change the text in the <small> tag to your name and student number.
