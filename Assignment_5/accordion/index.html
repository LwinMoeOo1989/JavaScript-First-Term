	Assignment 5 Part 2: Replace a Tabs widget with an Accordion widget

	In this assignment, you’ll modify an application that uses a Tabs widget to display 
	the content of three panels to an application that uses an Accordion widget to display 
	those panels.

	1. Review the content of the starter folder, accordion.
	
	*2. Modify the HTML so it can be used with the Accordion widget. To do that, you’ll need to 
	omit the list of tabs and add an h3 element for each panel. Then, make any additional 
	changes as appropriate.
	*3. In the HTML file, modify the jQuery code so it uses an Accordion widget. A panel should 
	be opened when the user clicks on it. If the panel is already opened, it should be closed.
	*4. In index.html, change the text in the <small> tag to your name and student number.
