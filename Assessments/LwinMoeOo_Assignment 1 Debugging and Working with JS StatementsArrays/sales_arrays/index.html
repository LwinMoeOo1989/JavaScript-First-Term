    Assignment 1 Part 3: Use a Sales array
    
    In this assignment, you’ll start with five arrays that represent 
    sales regions, and each array contains four values that represent 
    the quarterly sales for the region. Then, you’ll summarize the data 
    in the page, which should look like this:
    
    Sales by Quarter
    
    Q1: $9965
    Q2: $7403
    Q3: $9478
    Q4: $13061
    
    Sales by Region
    
    Region 1: $5355
    Region 2: $9585
    Region 3: $9398
    Region 4: $6195
    Region 5: $9374
    
    Total Sales
    
    $39907
    
    1. Review the content of the starter folder, sales_arrays.
    2. In the HTML file, note the link element that refers to the CSS file, 
    and the script element refers to the JavaScript file.
    3. In the JavaScript file, note that five arrays are declared 
    with four values in each. Each of these arrays represents one sales 
    region, and each of the values in an array represents one sales quarter. 
    For instance, the sales for the third quarter in region 3 were 2710. 
    
    *4. Write the code for summing the quarterly sales for each the five 
    regions and displaying them on the page with the document.write() method.
    To do that, use an <h2> tag for each header and a <br> tag for a line 
    break at the end of each line of sales data.
    *5. Write the code for getting and displaying the regional sales data.
    *6. Write the code for getting and displaying the total sales data.
    *7. In index.html, change the text in the <small> tag to your name and student number.
