    Assignment 1 Part 2: Modify the Test Scores application
    
    In this assignment, you’ll modify the Test Scores application 
    so it provides for four test scores and displays the results 
    in a dialog box like the one that follows.
    
    This page says
    
    Score 1 = 80
    Score 2 = 75
    Score 3 = 90
    Score 4 = 90
    
    Average score = 83
    
    1. Review the content of the starter folder, test_scores.
    2. Run the application, and note that it works like the one 
    in the book and that it writes the results to the browser page. 
    Then, review the code in the JavaScript file, and note that it’s 
    slightly different than the code in the book, although it gets 
    the same results.
    
    *3. Modify the application so it provides for a fourth test score.
    *4. Modify the application so it displays the results in a dialog box 
    by using alert() method like the one above, as well as in the browser page 
    after the dialog box is closed.
    *5. In index.html, change the text in the <small> tag to your name 
    and student number.
