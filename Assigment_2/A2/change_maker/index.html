	Assignment 2 Part 2: Develop the Change Calculator

	In this assignment, you’ll develop an application that 
	tells how many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies are needed 
	to make change for any amount of change from 0 through 99 cents. 
	One way to get the results is to use the divide and modulus 
	operators along with the parseInt() method for truncating 
	the results so they are whole numbers.

	1. Review the content of the starter folder, change_maker.
	Then, run the application to see the user interface, 
	although that interface won’t do anything until you develop 
	the JavaScript for it.
	
	*2. Code an event handler named validateInput() that gets 
	the user’s input and checks to make sure that it is a number 
	between 0 and 99.
	*3. If so, call a function named createChange() and pass it 
	the user’s input. Otherwise, display a dialog box 
	for the error.
	*4. Code the createChange() function, which should have one 
	parameter that accepts the user’s input. This function shouldn’t 
	return anything, but it should display the results in the text 
	boxes for Quarters, Dimes, Nickels, and Pennies.
	*5. Code a DOMContentLoaded event handler that attaches 
	the validateInput() event handler to the click event of 
	the Make Change button. Then, test this application.
	*6.	In index.html, change the text in the <small> tag 
	to your name and student number.
